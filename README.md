# PplSite

This project is based on [AngularJS](https://angular.io/), and uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for the UI components. Themes are built in [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Development server

Run one of these. A new broswer window will open up to http://localhost:4200
`npm run aus`
`npm run east`
`npm run west`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build and Push

Run any of these to push the fully built static site to Github. The output will be in `/docs/(aus|east|west)` depending on which one you build.

`npm run deploy aus`
`npm run deploy east`
`npm run deploy west`
